### **As if you know nothing about numerical computing:**

Imagine you’re trying to measure the area under a curve (like the ground under a hill on a graph). To do this:

1. Split the ground into small strips (subintervals).
2. Instead of trying to measure the exact area of each strip, you look at the **middle point** of the strip.
3. Measure the height of the curve at that middle point and assume it represents the whole strip’s height.
4. Multiply that height by the width of the strip to estimate the area for that strip.
5. Add up all these estimated areas for all the strips, and you’ll get an approximate total area under the curve.

This is what the **midpoint rule** does: it estimates the total area under a curve by using the midpoint of small sections to calculate the area of each strip.

### **As an expert:**

The **midpoint rule** is a numerical integration technique that approximates the value of a definite integral \( \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \). It is based on using the **midpoint** of each subinterval in a partition to estimate the integral.

#### Core Idea:
1. Divide the interval \([a, b]\) into \(n\) subintervals of equal width:
   \[
   h = \frac{b - a}{n}
   \]
2. Identify the midpoints of each subinterval:
   \[
   x_i^* = a + \left(i - \frac{1}{2}\right)h \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \dots, n
   \]
3. Evaluate the function \(f(x)\) at these midpoints \(x_i^*\).
4. Approximate the integral as:
   \[
   \int_a^b f(x) \, dx \approx h \sum_{i=1}^n f(x_i^*)
   \]

---

### **Derivation:**
The midpoint rule approximates the integral using the Riemann sum, but instead of evaluating \(f(x)\) at the left or right endpoints of the subintervals, it uses the midpoint:
\[
\int_a^b f(x) dx \approx \sum_{i=1}^n f\left(a + \left(i - \frac{1}{2}\right)h\right) h
\]
This choice reduces the error in the approximation for smooth functions.

---

### **Error Analysis:**
The error in the midpoint rule is proportional to the second derivative of \(f(x)\) and inversely proportional to \(n^2\):
\[
\text{Error} = -\frac{(b - a)^3}{24n^2} f''(\xi) \quad \text{for some } \xi \in [a, b]
\]
This makes the midpoint rule more accurate than the rectangular rule and sometimes comparable to the trapezoidal rule.

### **Applications:**
- Estimating areas under curves.
- Solving physical problems involving integrals (e.g., finding distances from velocity data).
- Often used when simplicity is required or function evaluations at midpoints are computationally efficient.

In summary, the **midpoint rule** provides a straightforward, yet effective, method for numerical integration by leveraging midpoint evaluations to better approximate the curve's behavior over each subinterval.
