### **As if you know nothing about numerical computing:**

Imagine you're trying to fit a straight line through a bunch of dots on a graph. These dots might represent data you’ve collected, like how fast a car is moving at different times.

The **least squares method** is like drawing a line that gets as close as possible to all those dots. Instead of eyeballing it, the method uses a rule: 

1. For each dot, it measures how far it is from the line (up or down).
2. It squares those distances (to make sure negative distances don’t cancel positive ones).
3. Then, it adds up all those squared distances to get a total "error."
4. The method finds the line where this total error is as small as possible.

In short, it’s a way to draw the "best" line through the dots by minimizing the total error.

### **As an expert:**

The **least squares method** is a mathematical optimization technique used to approximate the solution of overdetermined systems (where there are more equations than unknowns), typically in the context of data fitting.

#### Core Idea:
The method minimizes the **sum of squared residuals** between observed values (\(y_i\)) and values predicted by the model (\(\hat{y}_i\)).

#### Process:
1. **Model Setup:**
   - Assume a model: \( y = X\beta + \epsilon \), where:
     - \(y\): Vector of observed values.
     - \(X\): Design matrix containing predictor variables.
     - \(\beta\): Vector of coefficients (parameters) to estimate.
     - \(\epsilon\): Vector of errors (residuals).

2. **Objective:**
   - Minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS): 
     \[
     RSS = \sum_{i=1}^n (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 = \|y - X\beta\|^2
     \]

3. **Solution:**
   - Using calculus, the solution is derived by setting the derivative of RSS with respect to \(\beta\) to zero, leading to the **normal equations**:
     \[
     X^T X \beta = X^T y
     \]
   - The optimal \(\beta\) is given by:
     \[
     \beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
     \]

#### Key Properties:
- Assumes the errors \(\epsilon\) are normally distributed with constant variance (\( \sigma^2 \)).
- Efficient and widely used for linear regression and polynomial fitting.

#### Applications:
- Data fitting (e.g., finding trends in experimental data).
- Predictive modeling.
- Calibration of instruments.

In summary, the least squares method transforms a complex fitting problem into a solvable linear algebra problem, ensuring an optimal fit by minimizing the squared differences between observed and predicted values.
