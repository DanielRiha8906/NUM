### **As if you know nothing about numerical computing:**

Imagine you have a curve on a graph, and you want to figure out how steep it is at a specific point. The steepness is called the **slope**, and in math, it's the derivative.

The **numerical_derivative** function helps find this slope without needing fancy formulas. Here's how it works:
1. Pick two points very close to the spot where you want the slope.
2. Measure how much the curve goes up or down between those points.
3. Divide the "up or down" distance by the "side-to-side" distance between the two points.

This gives you an estimate of how steep the curve is at your chosen spot. The smaller the distance between the two points, the more accurate the slope.

### **As an expert:**

The **numerical_derivative** function uses the **central difference formula** to approximate the derivative of a function \(f(x)\) at a given point \(x\). This method leverages the definition of the derivative:
\[
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h}
\]

Since taking \(h \to 0\) is impractical in numerical computing, a small, fixed value of \(h\) (e.g., \(10^{-5}\)) is used to approximate the derivative.

---

#### **How It Works:**
1. **Central Difference Approximation:**
   The derivative is estimated by sampling the function at two points:
   - \(x + h\): Slightly to the right of \(x\).
   - \(x - h\): Slightly to the left of \(x\).

   The slope is then approximated by:
   \[
   f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2h}
   \]

2. **Why Central Difference?**
   - It is more accurate than forward or backward difference formulas because it uses points on both sides of \(x\), reducing error terms.
   - The error in this method is \(O(h^2)\), meaning it decreases quadratically as \(h\) becomes smaller.

3. **Choice of \(h\):**
   - \(h\) should be small enough to provide accuracy but not so small that floating-point errors dominate.

---

#### **Advantages:**
- Simple and efficient for functions where analytical derivatives are unavailable.
- Symmetrical, reducing truncation errors compared to forward or backward differences.

#### **Disadvantages:**
- The choice of \(h\) can affect accuracy:
  - Too large: The approximation deviates from the true derivative.
  - Too small: Numerical precision errors can increase.

---

#### **Applications:**
- Estimating derivatives in cases where only discrete data or computational functions are available.
- Solving problems in physics, engineering, and optimization where derivatives are required but analytical expressions are impractical.

In summary, the **numerical_derivative** function implements the central difference method, providing a practical and efficient way to approximate derivatives with controlled accuracy.
