### **As if you know nothing about numerical computing:**

Imagine you have a set of equations like this:
1. \(2x + y = 5\)
2. \(x - y = 1\)

You want to find out what \(x\) and \(y\) are. The **Gaussian Elimination Method (GEM)** helps solve these equations step by step, kind of like organizing a messy room:

1. First, focus on the first equation. Make sure it looks simple, so it’s easier to use (like keeping \(x\) alone).
2. Next, use that equation to "clean up" the others—remove \(x\) from them.
3. Keep going with the other variables (like \(y\)) until everything looks neat and orderly.
4. Once it’s tidy, start solving backward. Use the simpler equations to figure out the variables one by one, like finding \(y\) first and then \(x\).

This method works by breaking big, messy problems into smaller, manageable steps until the answer pops out.

### **As an expert:**

The **Gaussian Elimination Method (GEM)** is a systematic algorithm to solve a system of linear equations represented as:
\[
A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}
\]
where:
- \(A\) is an \(n \times n\) coefficient matrix.
- \(\mathbf{x}\) is the vector of unknowns.
- \(\mathbf{b}\) is the right-hand-side vector.

#### **Steps in GEM:**

1. **Forward Elimination:**
   - The goal is to transform the system into an upper triangular form:
     \[
     U \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}'
     \]
     where \(U\) is an upper triangular matrix.
   - For each pivot row \(k\) (from 1 to \(n-1\)):
     - Eliminate the \(k\)-th variable from all rows below it by subtracting a multiple of the \(k\)-th row.
     - The multiple (scaling factor) for row \(i\) is:
       \[
       \text{factor} = \frac{A[i, k]}{A[k, k]}
       \]

2. **Back Substitution:**
   - Once \(A\) is upper triangular, solve for the unknowns starting from the last row (\(n\)-th variable) and working upward:
     \[
     x_i = \frac{b_i' - \sum_{j=i+1}^{n} A[i, j] x_j}{A[i, i]}
     \]

#### **Key Operations in GEM:**
- Division (to compute factors).
- Row-wise subtraction (to eliminate variables).
- Summation during back substitution.

### **Explanation of Your Function:**

```R
gauss_elimination <- function(A, b) {
  n <- nrow(A)  # Number of equations (and variables)
  
  # Forward elimination
  for (k in 1:(n - 1)) {
    for (i in (k + 1):n) {
      factor <- A[i, k] / A[k, k]  # Compute factor
      A[i, k:n] <- A[i, k:n] - factor * A[k, k:n]  # Eliminate variable
      b[i] <- b[i] - factor * b[k]  # Update RHS vector
    }
  }
  
  # Back substitution
  x <- numeric(n)  # Initialize solution vector
  for (i in n:1) {  # Work backward from the last equation
    x[i] <- (b[i] - sum(A[i, (i + 1):n] * x[(i + 1):n])) / A[i, i]
  }
  
  return(x)  # Return the solution vector
}
```

#### **Inputs:**
- `A`: The coefficient matrix of the system.
- `b`: The right-hand-side vector.

#### **Outputs:**
- The solution vector \(\mathbf{x}\), which satisfies \(A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}\).

### **Advantages:**
- Systematic and general approach for any square system of linear equations.
- Leads directly to a solution if the matrix is non-singular.

### **Disadvantages:**
- Computationally expensive (\(O(n^3)\)).
- Numerical stability issues may arise, especially with poorly conditioned matrices (pivoting strategies can mitigate this).

---

### **Applications:**
- Solving equations in physics, engineering, and economics.
- Core step in algorithms for matrix inversion and determinant calculation.

In summary, **Gaussian Elimination** provides a step-by-step approach to simplifying and solving systems of linear equations, converting them into a triangular form for efficient solution extraction.
